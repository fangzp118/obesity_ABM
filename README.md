# obesity_ABM
An agent-based model for obesity, based on real NHANES data. A WORK IN PROGRESS!

I tried to reverse-engineer the model described in the following paper:

AM El-Sayed, L Seemann, P Scarborough, and S Galea. Are Network-Based Interventions a Useful Antiobesity Strategy? An Application of Simulation Models for Causal Inference in Epidemiology. Am J Epidemiol 2013; 178(2): 287-295.
